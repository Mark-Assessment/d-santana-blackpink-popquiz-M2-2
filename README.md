# Testing

## Automated Testing and Manual Testing

### Automated Testing

Automated testing is a type of testing that uses software tools to execute tests. It involves the use of specialized software to write and run test scripts that can quickly and efficiently test software applications. Here are the principles of automated testing:

* Repeatability: Automated tests are repeatable, meaning they can be run repeatedly with the same results.

* Consistency: Automated tests are consistent in the way they run and the results they produce.

* Efficiency: Automated tests can execute quickly and efficiently, which allows for faster testing and quicker feedback.

* Accuracy: Automated tests are more accurate than manual testing, as they reduce the chances of human error.

* Scalability: Automated tests can be scaled up to run thousands of tests in parallel, making it possible to test large and complex applications.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing is a type of testing that involves human testers manually executing test cases and exploring the software application to identify defects. It is a time-consuming and error-prone process, but it can be very effective in identifying defects that may be missed by automated testing. Here are the principles of manual testing:

* Exploratory: Manual testing involves exploring the software application to identify defects that may not be captured by test cases.

* Creativity: Manual testing requires creativity and critical thinking to identify defects that may not be obvious.

* Flexibility: Manual testing allows testers to adjust their testing approach based on the results they find.

* Adaptability: Manual testing allows testers to adapt to changes in the software application or testing environment.

* User perspective: Manual testing can provide a user perspective on the software application.

## Functionality testing 

 I used Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and for style issues.


## Compatibility testing
 Site was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices in Chrome developer tools. 
 
 I tested on hardware devices such as: Ipad air with iOS, Iphone SE mini with iOS , Macbook air with MacOS


## User stories testing

### As a User :

- As user I want you to land on main website page and be able to tell what is the game about.
    >Expected results is user looking at the logo and identifying the main theme of the website and see the rules of the game straightaway.

- As user I want the user to easily navigate through the website.
    > The expected results is user looking at the buttons in game and be able to press them and pass to the next question.

- I want my customers to be able to identify the correct and wrong answers.
    > User can see whith the colors red and green which answers is correct and the score is reflected.


## Issues found during site development

* #### Button not showing right or wrong color. 

When the user selected the answer the wrong or right color styling rule wasnt been applied to the relevant buttons.
> I fixed it by ussing bootstrap custom style classes instead of writing my own style .

![Desktop website problem](images/problem-3.png)

* #### The counter was not been reset at the end of the game.

When counter for questions and score in the footer was not working.
> I fixed this by reseting the counter variable every time that the reset button was pressed.

## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=es) tool to check performance of the website.

Final results:

## Code Validation
 At the and of the project I used two websites to validate my code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS


 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML


 * [Jshint Checker](https://jshint.com/) to test Javascript
